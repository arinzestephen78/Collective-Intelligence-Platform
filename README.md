# Decentralized Collective Intelligence Platform (DCIP)

A blockchain-based platform for amplifying collective intelligence through decentralized collaboration, AI integration, and tokenized incentives.

## Overview

DCIP enables distributed groups to collaboratively solve complex problems by combining:
- Smart contract-managed challenge framework
- Reputation-based contribution system
- Tokenized rewards
- AI-assisted evaluation and ideation
- NFT-based intellectual property rights management

## Core Components

### Challenge Management System
- Smart contracts handle challenge creation, submission management, and reward distribution
- Configurable parameters for challenge duration, acceptance criteria, and reward structure
- Multi-stage evaluation process combining peer review and AI analysis
- Automated milestone tracking and deliverable verification

### Reputation System
- ERC-20 based reputation tokens (DCIP-R) earned through:
    - Quality of submissions (peer + AI evaluated)
    - Impact of implemented solutions
    - Participation in review processes
    - Community engagement
- Reputation scores influence voting weight and reward multipliers
- Anti-gaming mechanisms prevent manipulation
- Reputation decay over time encourages continued participation

### Solution NFTs
- ERC-721 tokens represent verified breakthrough solutions
- Embedded metadata includes:
    - Complete solution documentation
    - Contribution history
    - Impact metrics
    - Usage rights
- Revenue sharing smart contracts for commercial applications
- Secondary market for trading solution rights

### AI Integration
- Solution evaluation and scoring
- Pattern recognition across submissions
- Idea combination and enhancement suggestions
- Automated documentation generation
- Quality control and duplicate detection
- Contribution classification and tagging

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Core platform contracts
contract DCIPCore {
    // Challenge management
    // Reputation tracking
    // Solution verification
    // Reward distribution
}

contract ReputationToken is ERC20 {
    // Reputation minting/burning
    // Score calculation
    // Governance weights
}

contract SolutionNFT is ERC721 {
    // Solution metadata
    // Rights management
    // Revenue sharing
}
```

### Backend Services
- AI evaluation pipeline
- IPFS integration for content storage
- Oracle services for external data
- Analytics and reporting engine

### Integration Points
- Web3 wallet integration
- AI model APIs
- External data sources
- Knowledge base connections

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy contracts: `npm run deploy`
5. Start local node: `npm run node`

### Basic Usage
```javascript
// Initialize platform
const dcip = new DCIPPlatform({
    network: 'testnet',
    aiProvider: 'openai',
    ipfsGateway: 'https://ipfs.io'
});

// Create new challenge
await dcip.createChallenge({
    title: 'Optimize Solar Panel Efficiency',
    description: '...',
    rewards: {
        tokens: 1000,
        nftRights: true
    },
    duration: 30 // days
});

// Submit solution
await dcip.submitSolution({
    challengeId: 123,
    content: '...',
    supportingDocs: ['...']
});
```
